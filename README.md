# PharmaZ
My project for the Internet and Web Programming course - online pharmacy with drug predictions based on patient parameters

The website was an online pharmacy portal with multiple functionalities like prescription search, login, sign up, contact etc.

The interface is shown below. The next images are of the  Order Tests Page, Buy Meds Online page, and the Search Prescription Page.
